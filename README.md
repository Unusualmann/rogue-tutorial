# rogue-tutorial

Howdy! This is my code as of the end of the libtcod python 3 roguelike tutorial found here: http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1
I plan to expand the results of this tutorial into a slightly larger game. 
My problem is this: after completing it, I discovered that the inventory menu would not show up when "I" is pressed.
When "I" is pressed, the menu itself does not appear on screen, but input reacts as though it is on screen: pressing "A" will cause
you to unequip your dagger, B will let you drink the poition assigned to the B slot, etc.
However, the menu *does* show up when "D" is pressed, the key for dropping things from the inventory.
This issue only started happening at the end of part 13 of the tutorial; it worked fine before then. Halp?
