# rogue-tutorial

Howdy! This is my code after finishing and expanding upon the libtcod python 3 roguelike tutorial found here: http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1

Some differences from the original tutorial are:

  -a slightly different control scheme (backspace to exit game, esc to exit a menu, numpad controls)
  
  -added CROSSBOWS (the feature i am most proud of)
  
  -revamped old enemies and added other, wackier enemies:
  
      -goblins, orcs trolls, and dark knights follow standard enemy behavior and are identical apart from their stats (each tougher than the previous)
      
      -special goblin that moves fast
      
      -fairies which die in one hit but cannot be killed with the crossbow (GASP) and have a high damage attack
      
      -kobold with a higher melee range than most enemies (two blocks, not one)
      
      -lord of evil (boss) who has three different attacks (standard melee, melee fire magic, ranged scream attack)
      
  -win condition: kill the lord of evil on floor 11 to win
  
  -defense now has a degree of randomness to it
  
  -lightning scroll now affected by defense (but fireball scroll is not)
  
  -main menu background (file named (menu_background) replaced with ~~a paint.net doodle~~ a beautiful 4k ultra HD artwork of my own design (look at that REALISM)
  
  -removed herobrine
  
It's no Witcher 3, but I think I did alright.
